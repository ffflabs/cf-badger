## FAQ

### :shield: Private Repos vs Public Badges

Status badges are awesome. What's not to love about a self contained, colorful piece of relevant info? You could build a tiny dashboard displaying the status of your company integration pipelines and give it to the sales team so they can go and perform their act :money_mouth_face: !! ...except you cant :cry:. Not when it's **private repos** we're talking about, *unless you give them access to the code*. 

Even for something as simple as previewing your README.md on your IDE of choice, it turns out you will end up seeing broken images.

<div align="center" style="font-size:0.8em;text-align:center">How to get from broken to flawless?</div>

</p>

You can't, for example, make use of Shields.io's excellent service. They explicitly do not support  private repos. And while :octocat: Github provides badges, only logged in users with access to the repo will receive other than a 404 error.

##### üéâ Enter **CF-Badger** !!

It will present you with a brief form (which, by the way, is hosted on [Cloudflare Pages](https://pages.cloudflare.com)) whose final output is a short url to the status badge, updated every 5 minutes.

### üéØ How?

 We request the outcome of your workflows directly to Github's API, on your behalf. To do this, we'll need you to provide a [personal access token](https://github.com/settings/tokens/new?scopes=repo&description=cf-badger.com) with 'repo' privileges.  


This result is formatted in compliance to Shields.io schema, and provided as parameter to [Shields.io endpoint API](https://shields.io/endpoint), (üôå without which CF-Badger wouldn't work). 

Finally, we'll generate and provide you with a shortened URL to the computed status badge

</p>

**üîê Security wise**, this token is stored internally on the persistent storage of a [Durable Object](https://blog.cloudflare.com/introducing-workers-durable-objects/) and it's never exposed to third parties nor used other than to query Github's API on your behalf. 

If your use case for CF-Badger involves public repos, we still need you to enter a token, albeit with the much narrower and harmless `public_repo` scope. **However**, for that use case, you might want to use Shields.io direcly. Just look in their [Builds Category](https://shields.io/category/build) for "Github Workflows" section.


### ü§∑ Why do you address yourself as "we" if you're the only contributor? 


It kinda makes the project sound like a serious initiative.

**[Cloudflare Workers](https://www.cloudflare.com/products/workers)**, along with [Workers KV](https://www.cloudflare.com/products/workers-kv/), [Cloudflare Pages](https://pages.cloudflare.com/) and [Durable Objects](https://blog.cloudflare.com/introducing-workers-durable-objects/). This is the blazing fast platform on which CF-Badger runs and replicates over 200+ locations worldwide. Did I mention CF-Badger is my project for the **[Cloudflare Developer Summer Challenge](https://challenge.developers.cloudflare.com/)**?

**[Shields.io](https://shields.io)**, whose service renders actual badges and without which CF-Badger would generate broken images, which would be ironic.

**[Atrox's Github Actions Badge](https://actions-badge.atrox.dev/)**, on which CF-Badger was inspired. Albeit I used (and loved) its functionality, I didn't feel comfortable having my token displayed in the badge's URL query parameters, and I also needed to track several workflows for each repo.
